# CUNY Borough of Manhattan Community College Relevant Major Courses

This repository just exists to be a drop off spot for all the coursework I did in the CIS/CSC department at BMCC.

While not everything is a finished product in these courses, it does serve as a nice reminder of how much I've done with my short time being here :)

_Also it allows me to remove these folders from my laptop ;)_

## Some Accomplishments

1. In my [csc111](https://github.com/EmmanuelR21/BMCC_Courses/tree/main/csc111) class, I was retaking C++ after having bombed my C++ course in City College. The [Final Project](https://github.com/EmmanuelR21/BMCC_Courses/tree/main/csc111/finalProject) was a personal achievement of mine, proving to myself I could bounce back, no AI nor external help, just me and the second hand stress at having learned how mortgages worked :(
